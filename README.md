# DeXter
DeXter Printer is an experimental project that seeks to investigate the potential of using a low cost Dexion frame as the main structural component for a 3D printer.
The project is currently in the development stage, and although there are some challenges to address, it is anticipated to conclude by the end of the year 2023.
